## Get Started

Open to the Public (OTTP) is an open collaboration protocol. View main [/protocol](https://opentothepublic.org/protocol) repo.

This is the repository for the OTTP web client.

Version: v0
Note: The OTTP SDK is being updated. The web client will be built on the SDK.

This app will follow the following structure laid out [here](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md)

## How to Run

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Requirements

- Nodejs 18 or greater
- npm

Note: you can run both these commands to ensure your machine has them installed

```
node -v
npm -v
```

### Steps

1. run `npm ci`
2. run `npm run dev` to view the live application on `http://localhost:3000/`

### Connect with EAS

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
